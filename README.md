This repository contains the source code and screenshots of all the projects I developed during the GeeksforGeeks “21 Days, 21 Projects” Challenge.

Throughout this challenge, I built hands-on projects daily, strengthening my problem-solving skills, frontend development fundamentals, and practical coding experience.
